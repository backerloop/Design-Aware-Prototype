Prompt:

You are designing a design-aware prototype landing page for a fintech product called BackerLoop.

This is not a production site, but it must look like a real product, suitable for demoing to:

creators

investors

lawyers

The output should be a single static HTML file with embedded CSS (no JS frameworks, no React).

Product Context

BackerLoop enables revenue-based financing for creators.

Creators raise capital from their audience in exchange for a fixed percentage of future revenue.
Backers receive allocations automatically as revenue is reported.

This page must clearly communicate:

what the product does

how it works

why it’s trustworthy

without hype or exaggeration

Design Requirements (Very Important)

The design should feel:

calm

serious

intentional

financial / legal friendly

Avoid:

bright colors

gradients

playful visuals

startup hype language

emojis

Use:

neutral color palette (white, light gray, charcoal, muted blue)

modern sans-serif font (Inter, system UI, or similar)

generous whitespace

card-based layout

clear typographic hierarchy

This should look like a credible prototype, not a marketing toy.

Page Structure (Must Follow This Order)
1. Hero Section

Headline:
Revenue-based financing for creators and their communities

Subheadline:
Raise capital from fans without giving up equity. Backers receive a fixed share of future revenue, allocated automatically.

Primary CTA button:
View Live Demo

Secondary link:
“How it works”

2. Problem Section

Heading:
Creators need capital. Fans want to support.

Explain briefly:

creators need upfront capital

fans want more than donations

existing options are limited

Include a short bullet list:

Equity is complex and illiquid

Donations have no upside

Loans add fixed repayment pressure

3. Solution Section

Heading:
BackerLoop bridges that gap.

Explain:

creators define a revenue share

fans purchase participation units

revenue is allocated automatically

Use short, readable paragraphs.

4. How It Works (Step-Based)

Four clearly numbered steps:

Create a financing round

Fans back the creator

Revenue is reported

Allocation happens automatically

Each step should be visually separated (cards or vertical layout).

5. Why It’s Different (Trust Section)

Use a 2×2 or 1×4 card layout with:

No custody of funds

Deterministic allocation logic

Transparent revenue ledger

Aligned incentives

This section is critical for legal credibility.

6. Who It’s For

Three cards:

Creators

Backers

Advisors & Legal

Each with 1–2 sentences of calm, professional copy.

7. Live Demo CTA

Reinforce credibility:

“See the mechanics in action”

Button: View Live Demo

8. Disclaimer Footer

This copy must be included verbatim:

BackerLoop is a demonstration platform illustrating revenue allocation mechanics.
No funds are held, transferred, or custodied by BackerLoop.

Footer should be visually subtle.

Output Requirements

Output only HTML + CSS

No placeholder lorem ipsum

No external JS libraries

No animations

No signup forms

No email capture

No auth

This is a storytelling surface, not a conversion funnel.

Tone Summary (Do Not Ignore)

This page should feel like:

“early but serious”

“unfinished but thoughtful”

“safe to show a lawyer”

“real enough for creators to react to”
